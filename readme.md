### To Explain Regrex Pattern

1. ^ : The caret symbol ^ at the beginning of the regular expression represents the start of a line. It ensures that the pattern we are searching for occurs at the beginning of a line.
2. \[^;\]\* : The \[^;\] part is a character class denoted by square brackets. It matches any character that is not a semicolon ;. The asterisk \* following the character class means "zero or more occurrences," so \[^;\]\* will match any sequence of characters that does not contain semicolons.
3. ; : The semicolon ; matches the actual semicolon character in the text.
